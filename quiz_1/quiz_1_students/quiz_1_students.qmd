2.  Quarto Basics

    (a) In the YAML at the top of this file, replace `YOUR NAME` with your name. \[1 Mark\]
    (b) Put the following words in the appropriate font:
        (i) Bold \[0.5 Marks\]

            **Bold**

        (ii) Italics \[0.5 Marks\]

             *Italic*

        (iii) Code \[0.5 Marks\]

              `code`

3.  Write the following equations using LaTeX math syntax so that they render properly. Write them using display math. \[2 Marks each\]

> (a) The simple linear regression model:

$$ 
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + u_i 
$$


> (b) The sample mean:

$$
\bar X = \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1} X_i  
$$

3.  Insert an image using Markdown image syntax. \[5 Marks\]
    -   Use the image in the uw-logo-centre-stack-black.png file, but it must render
    -   Add a caption that reads: Figure 1: University of Winnipeg Logo.

![Figure 1: University of Winnipeg Logo](uw-logo-centre-stack-black.png)

3.  Insert an R chunk and add an Image Using R. Use the `echo: false` execution option, so that the code does not show in the PDF.

```{r}
'echo: false'

```

```         
(a) Generate a variable $x=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)$ \[1 Mark\]
(b) Generate a variable $y= 2x+5$ \[1 Mark\]
(c) Create a simple plot with $x$ on the $x$-axix and $y$ on the $y$-axis using the `plot()` function.
(d) Add a figure caption "Simple Plot of $X$ Versus $Y$" using the quarto execution command `fig-cap`.
(e) Add the label `fig-scatterplot` using the `label` execution command
(f) Reference the plot in a sentence below the plot
```

```{r}
x <- (1:10)
y <- 2*x + 5

plot(x = x,
     y = y,
     main = "Simple Plot of X versus Y")


```



4.  

    (a) Create a data frame using `data.frame()` called `students` with columns `name` and `grade` with the following rows:

| name | grade |
|------|-------|
| Ana  | 82    |
| Ben  | 75    |
| Cara | 91    |
| Dan  | 68    |

> We want the code to print in the PDF, so set `echo: true`. Compute and print the average grade.

```{r}
students <- data.frame(
name = c("Ana","Ben","Cara","Dan"),
grade = c(82, 75, 91, 68)
)

'echo: true'

avg_grade <- sum(students$grade)/length(students$name)

```

6.  Commit the finished quiz to your GitHub profile \[1 Mark\]
